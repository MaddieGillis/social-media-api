# Social Media API

## Description
GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia

THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia

THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

I was able to get some experience with mongoose and was able to work on my routing skills. An unintended lesson, I learned about was how to use npm init as the package.json was not being created during installation.

## Installation
To install needed packages type “npm install” into the command line.

## Usage
To start the server type “npm start” into the command line and the server launches on port 3001
